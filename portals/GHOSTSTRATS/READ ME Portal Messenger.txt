# GhostStrats Cyberpunk Portal Messenger

This is a one-time-use **offline HTML messenger system** designed for secure communication between a host and a connecting user through a local captive portal or hotspot.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- The **host** of the portal edits this HTML file and **replaces the default message** (e.g., “This is a test message. Please respond.”) with their custom message or prompt.
- A **user** connects to the host’s Wi-Fi access point and opens the captive portal in their browser.
- The user sees the custom message and has a field to **submit a response**.
- Once they submit, the message is saved **locally on the host device** using `localStorage`.
- This portal is designed to be used **once per message** — after submission, the user should **disconnect** from Wi-Fi.

---

## 🧠 Host Instructions

1. Open the `.html` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the line that says:  
   `"This is a test message. Please respond."`
3. Replace it with your own question or prompt.
4. Save the file and host it using:
   - A captive portal device (ESP32/ESP8266)
   - A Wi-Fi Pineapple / custom AP
   - Or open it manually on your device browser

## 📥 Viewing the Response

After a user submits their response:
- The message is saved in the host browser’s local storage under the key:
  ```
  ghoststrats_msgs
  ```
- You can retrieve the saved responses by opening the browser console (F12) and running:
  ```javascript
  console.log(localStorage.getItem("ghoststrats_msgs"));
  ```
