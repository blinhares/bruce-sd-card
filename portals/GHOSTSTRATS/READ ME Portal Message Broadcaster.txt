# Portal Message Broadcaster

This tool is a **broadcast-only HTML portal** used to display a custom message to anyone who connects to your local Wi-Fi signal. There is **no login**, **no password**, and **no interaction** — just a simple message shown to the connecting user.

---

## 📡 How It Works

- The host sets up a Wi-Fi hotspot or captive portal.
- Any device that connects to this network will automatically be directed to a web page containing your message.
- There is **no response field** and **no password required**.

---

## ✏️ Customizing the Message

To edit the broadcasted message:

1. Open the `.html` file in a text editor.
2. Find the section that says:
   ```
   This is a test broadcast message.
   ```
3. Replace it with your own message.
4. Save the file and deploy it on your captive portal, access point, or embedded device.

This makes it ideal for:
- Emergency broadcasts
- Quick local alerts
- Digital signage or presence awareness
- Communication during offline events
